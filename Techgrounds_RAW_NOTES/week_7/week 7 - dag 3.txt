Week 7 - Day 3, 24-4-2024
Morning notes
With: Shikha
-	Soft skills: self-reflection. We will have another assignment. One of us will be chosen by the wheel of fortune to answer a question, just like last week. Shay will not have to present.
-	The self-reflection information can be found in the drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bjf5EANZ9AdL6VxYXmzegCup4nAWIF1n
-	Shikha told us about a workshop she attended at AWS two years ago. It was about "feeling worthy, thinking about your achievements."
-	AWS is a partner of Techgrounds (they sponsor our exams?), and JP Morgan is a sponsor of Techgrounds.
-	Sam had an accident this morning; unfortunately, he stepped on glass.
-	The students are feeling a bit tired today. Most of them are on the second assignment of Azure and did not do much homework after the JP Morgan workshop.


**Techgrounds JP Morgan Soft Skills Workshop**

**Alexandra said:**
JP Morgan is the biggest US bank in the world. 240,000 employees worldwide.
JP Morgan has a  philanthropic foundation: within that ,  this workshop is given

**Fady said:**
Did an intro about the JP Morgan team. He invited us to contact the JP Morgan team for any information.

**Ground rules:**
Let it be confidential, participate, respect, have fun.

Know  that this is really your chance to know more about banking and JP Morgan.

**JP Morgan Employees:**
- They do this out of goodwill.
- They sponsor Techgrounds.
- Everyone has a degree mostly, who got hired at JP Morgan.
- They did not know much info about Cloud Engineer job possibilities.

**Gabi:**
Was a sport athlete: learned to go for goals. Sometimes you get them or you don't though?
Personal Brand, according to her is: what do you want to be known for?
For example : she minded her looks and her habits,  to be on time,to be  trustworthy. When she did ths she felt more confident.
She wants to make sure she has a name (brand) of : "she will get it done."

Personal Brand is also something you stand for.
But what happens if it gets damaged? Ask more questions: to find out about the critique.
Maybe it was something in a blind spot. And maybe the critique could be valid and needs to be handled. So that you can be a  better person afterwards.

**Tips:**
- Stay true to yourself.
- Everyone can bring something to the table.

**Umbra, said:**
How to prepare for an interview:
- Prepare!
- Know yourself, get to know the company.
- Present yourself accordingly and fitting, if kindness is required for the job : prove it, show it.

TIp : Look at the company website!
Get general knowledge about the sector.
Look at the role you apply for and prepare some questions.
Try to know who will be the interviewer: adapt to him when possible. Make questions which he may like and know.

Apply the STAR format. When applicable.
Situation: describe a situation you had to deal with.
Task: the task you were given.
Action: the action you took.
Result: what happened as a result, what did you learn.

Reminder: prepare questions for the interviewer.

**Tip:** Write good motivational letters, not everyone takes time to do this, you can stand out here.
- Practice interviews with friends.
- Even if you do not have all prerequisites: go for it.
- The first look is CV, make it NEAT! This is the first thing people see and can reject you on.
- Make a great LinkedIn profile!
- Do not get discouraged, apply right the next day.

Regarding questions at the interview:
- You learn more about the position, you show interest and preparation.
- You get to know each other better and have a more equal position towards each other.
- Tip: ask about the process after the application.
- Do NOT ask about the salary right away, this comes later when they like you: then you have a better negotiation position too.
Do not come over and a money hunter.
Mind that you should really like the job and environment, over the pay. Otherwise, it could be really frustrating and end not very well.

**Pascal:**
Tip: ask questions of examples, so you do know the task and what you are expected to do.

He did the TELL YOUR LIFE STORY:
He did it with connection, he told about his challenges (languages) he had, and how he overcame them.
- he told about the things he liked
- he tried to emphasize, to tell your life story really as a story.

**Tamil Arends (director):**
Gave an example of his customer RTL, about what the right price was.
He mentioned he is the director: he finds it IMPORTANT that someone is PREPARED. And he told us that he encounters people who are super smart or experienced but UNPREPARED.

Take time why you are required, and useful for a company. This is NUMBER ONE for him!
Again, do not make your CV and motivation letter in a rush.
He likes that, as a person from the hiring side.

He wants that the person is loyal, likable to work with, is it a Yes sayer, is he authentic, is he being himself. Try to connect with the person, with who you are.

The interview = 3-way street, try to get in your information.
He liked that people questioned him too. Personal questions.
Try to fit into the team, feel happy.
If you are not happy, the chance that you fail or leave us high and they want long-term relationships.

He also likes the MOTIVATION: does the person know something about the company? Has this person thought about why this person is a good fit, and about what he can deliver to the table???

AFTER THIS: then the papers and qualifications are looked at.

He said: he likes to ask for EXAMPLES!

He would ask for an example of teamwork in real life. Like with family or with friends.

If you are confronted with a question which you cannot answer: make it broader, or give a similar example.

This guy does not like: made-up BS. A no-go!
Say instead "I do not know", and tell something which you DO know (relatable)


**Exercise:**
1-minute pitch, with feedback.

My Personal Feedback about my life story speech:
- make it short, I exceeded 1 minute
- make it fluent
- you can tell about where you come from, and what you have done. And where I want to head to.
- also add about examples of technical experiences.
- you do not have to go too deep at first
- the person who you apply to has to have the feeling he wants to know you more.
- make a story, that is easier to remember also.
