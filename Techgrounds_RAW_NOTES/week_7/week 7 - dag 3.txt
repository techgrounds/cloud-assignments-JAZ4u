Week 7 - Day 3, 24-4-2024
Morning notes
With: Shikha
-	Soft skills: self-reflection. We will have another assignment. One of us will be chosen by the wheel of fortune to answer a question, just like last week. Shay will not have to present.
-	The self-reflection information can be found in the drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bjf5EANZ9AdL6VxYXmzegCup4nAWIF1n
-	Shikha told us about a workshop she attended at AWS two years ago. It was about "feeling worthy, thinking about your achievements."
-	AWS is a partner of Techgrounds (they sponsor our exams?), and JP Morgan is a sponsor of Techgrounds.
-	Sam had an accident this morning; unfortunately, he stepped on glass.
-	The students are feeling a bit tired today. Most of them are on the second assignment of Azure and did not do much homework after the JP Morgan workshop.
