Morning Notes with Casper:
23-4-2024

- Today is JP Morgan day: it starts at 13:00 on Strawinskylaan 1135, Amsterdam, Netherlands.
- Shay is not attending the JP Morgan workshop (as he is ill); he asked us to share the workshop results afterwards.
- Casper says we need to look tidy for JP Morgan, as it is a formal environment.
- Moniek will be at the JP Morgan Workshop.
- At JP Morgan, we will meet the CRM students.
- Be punctual; do not arrive late at the JP Morgan Workshop.
- The 4 students decided to continue working in the morning in the breakout rooms until we have to leave for JP Morgan. Our next meetup will be there at Strawinskylaan.
- Shay said he had an idea of how the JP MORGAN workshop will go: the idea is to present the material in small groups to each other and then receive feedback.

ABOUT BEING LATE IN ZOOM CALLS:
- Jaz was a few minutes late to the Zoom call.
- From now on, Casper will mention (report?) if people are late twice; this first time, he will let it go with a warning.
