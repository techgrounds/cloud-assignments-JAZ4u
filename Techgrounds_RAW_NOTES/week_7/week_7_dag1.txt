Week 7 , dag 1 (22-4-2024)
With Shikha
Today first day Azure:
-	Casper will share a description (about Azure?)
-	(Techgrounds) Azure only allows 1 person to create subscriptions , according to Shikha?
-	Go through infrasturcture of Azure dilligently , as you need it for your AZ900 exam.
"AZ900 is theory based exam where practical knoweldge is not checked thus pls read all theoretical stuff like Global Instrastruture, Cost, Advantages, Shared Security Model and services for its use cases . They may be bit boring for worth to learn to pass AZ 900."

-	We will also get a Learnworld practical part, Shikha/Casper activates acces to that.
-	Today Elmarie presents the Sprint review about Asymmetrical encryption
-	at JP Morgan workshop we will meet Casper and Moniek, also the other Techgrounds students are there (CRM)
-	The JP Morgan Workshop will start at ... ?  Will we be needed ,online , in the morning? Or will this be our only task for that day: just login with Casper at 9 so he can tell you about this!
-	From now on we only have 4 sprint reviews (ideally)
-	try to finish the Azure topics (assingments)  before monday , if you finish your homework everyday on time GREAT. Otherwise: do not worry , it is part of the learning process.
-	from 10th -15th may Jaz is in Poland, he will do his best to  make sure he can connect to the course and zoom meeting then.
-	Shay was not online this morning , he did not log on , so maybe he is ill?
-	On 24th April, we will have NHT for "Self-reflection".

Afternoon notes, with Shikha 22-4-2024:
General:
- Shikha had us present our check-ins again with an object.
- Shay was absent for part of this morning because he was tired and had a medical problem that needed attention. He starts after lunch with his Azure assignments.
- Elmarie had to leave after her presentation for personal reasons. She had informed us beforehand. And she needs to go at 16:30.



Shikha's MD file review:
- TIP regarding MD files & screenshots: Put all screenshots in the Includes folder. This way, you could theoretically change the MD file position without losing or breaking the image links. Keep putting the images in the Includes folder!
- Jaz MD file feedback: Fill in USED SOURCES for whatever source you used, and in ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS, fill in any problem you encountered. When you did not encounter a problem, fill in "No problem encountered."
- Elmaries MD file feedback: A good point was that Elmarie used pictures to describe things easily. That is a very good way to make things clear. Do it whenever you can. Shikha suggested she ANSWER questions in the shortest description possible first and then elaborate afterwards, when needed.
- Shays MD file feedback: Put all the assignments of the specific week in the same folder. Do not mix assignments from different weeks in the same folder. Also, use more bolding/bullet points/highlighting.
Shay worded this :
"I needed to order the exercises by subject, and not week. As I have them now they are ordered by week, but because we had two different subjects in one week, it is unclear for anyone outside of the study that a folder called 'security' will also contain Python exercises."
- Sams MD file feedback: Create separate folders for separate topics. Python for Python assignments, Linux for Linux assignments, Security for security assignments. Mind your formatting; use different font sizes.
- NOTE: Shikha sees in general no problems with the MD files of the current students.



Regarding Elmarie's SPRINT presentation:
Questions:
- Why was it challenging, but in retrospect not? (Would have been Jaz's question.)
- Shikha asked: When would you choose asymmetrical or symmetrical encryption?


Feedback of Shikha to Elmarie regarding Sprint Presentation:
- The assignment part in the presentation was copied one-on-one too much.
- Shikha said she found herself "reading" the slides too much. Slides are not for the audience to read; they will take away attention. So, do not write too much information on the slides. Try to use small sentences or terms.
+ Other than that: Neat presentation.
- Jaz's personal learning point from this presentation: I should bring only facts and verifiable information or emphasize that it is my own idea or view (which, in my humble opinion, should be short and considered less important, unless specifically asked).
