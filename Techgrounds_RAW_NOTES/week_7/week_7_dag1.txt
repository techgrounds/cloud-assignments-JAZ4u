Week 7 , dag 1 (22-4-2024)
With Shikha
Today first day Azure:
-	Casper will share a description (about Azure?)
-	(Techgrounds) Azure only allows 1 person to create subscriptions , according to Shikha?
-	Go through infrasturcture of Azure dilligently , as you need it for your AZ900 exam.
"AZ900 is theory based exam where practical knoweldge is not checked thus pls read all theoretical stuff like Global Instrastruture, Cost, Advantages, Shared Security Model and services for its use cases . They may be bit boring for worth to learn to pass AZ 900."

-	We will also get a Learnworld practical part, Shikha/Casper activates acces to that.
-	Today Elmarie presents the Sprint review about Asymmetrical encryption
-	at JP Morgan workshop we will meet Casper and Moniek, also the other Techgrounds students are there (CRM)
-	The JP Morgan Workshop will start at ... ?  Will we be needed ,online , in the morning? Or will this be our only task for that day: just login with Casper at 9 so he can tell you about this!
-	From now on we only have 4 sprint reviews (ideally)
-	try to finish the Azure topics (assingments)  before monday , if you finish your homework everyday on time GREAT. Otherwise: do not worry , it is part of the learning process.
-	from 10th -15th may Jaz is in Poland, he will do his best to  make sure he can connect to the course and zoom meeting then.
-	Shay was not online this morning , he did not log on , so maybe he is ill?
-	On 24th April, we will have NHT for "Self-reflection".

Regarding Elmaries presentation feedback :
Elmaries own opinion about the presentation:

Questions:why was it challenging, but in retrospect not?
 - 	where would you choose assymetrical or symmetrical encryption


Feedback of Shikha:
-	The assignment part in the presenatiton wat copied 1 on 1 too much 
- 	slides are not to let the public READ, they will take away the attention ( so do not write too much information on the slides)  Try to use small sentences. 
otherwise Neat presentation. Shikha said she found herself " reading" the slides too much.
* my own learningpoint from this presentation: I should bring only facts and verifiable information , or SPECIFICALLY say it is my idea or view ( which may be of less importance)

Afternoon notes:
-	Shikha had us present our checkins again with a tool 
- 	Shay was tired and had a skin problem: he starts in the afternoon on his Azure assignments
- 	TIP regarding MD files: put all screenshots in the include folder, becuase than you could theoretically change the md file position without losing/breaking the image links.
