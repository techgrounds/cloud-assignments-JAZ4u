Afternoon notes, with Shikha (15-4-'24):
- Shikha had us give an object to eachother before Check in , this was to make it more interesting ( playful excersice)
- we have a new topic for the presentation it is about : Security ( on next monday )
- Sprint Presentation 22nd of April, more details : It has to be about Asymmetric encryption. Give a brief explanation (what is it and how it is different from symmetric encryption)
- Shikha will contact Monique , regarding this JP Morgan reassignment we need to do, as it is not sent to us yet?
- Elmarie can't present this security ( she has an appointment) . So guess who has to present Security... If Sam does not show up then Shay or Jaz will have to present.
- Reminder about the JP Morgan workshop: IT IS MANDATORY, we are ALL EXPECTED
- in the future we have to do EACH week a Sprint Presentation, and the presentation will be prepared individually ( no longer with the team ). The Learning Coaches will choose with this wheel of fortune selection thing,
- Shikha informed us  that Casper wants(has?)  to delete our virtual machines. I have asked to delete it 22-4-2024. She said OK to that.
- Shikha suggests we do CKA: Certified Kubernetes Administrator ( this is to prove you are skilled with LINUX )
- FoR CKA you can Start with Docker( to practise / or its free?)
