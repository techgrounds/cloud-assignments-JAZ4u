LINUX

-Find out your current working directory.
jaz@Nest-Ja-Nieste:~$ pwd
/home/jaz

-Make a listing of all files and directories in your home directory.
jaz@Nest-Ja-Nieste:/home$ ls
jaz

-Within your home directory, create a new directory named ‘techgrounds’.
jaz@Nest-Ja-Nieste:/home$ sudo mkdir techgrounds
jaz@Nest-Ja-Nieste:/home$ ls
jaz  techgrounds

regarding a permission issue with Linux.
-When there are permissions iussues : check the permissions and modify . This is possible

Solution I delted the files 
$ sudo rm -v file2.txt 
https://learnubuntu.com/delete-files/?utm_content=cmp-true

After deletion i remade new files with NANO

-to edit text : add a texteditor , there is a buildin text editor.

$ NANO

opdracht:
Move around your directory tree using both absolute and relative paths.

source: https://linuxhandbook.com/absolute-vs-relative-path/

Solution:
you may use the absolute path that starts with the root directory (/):

ls -l /home/abhishek/scripts/my_script.sh
Or, you can use the relative path (which starts from the current directory, not /):

ls -l scripts/my_script.sh
Both commands will yield the same result (except for the path of the file).









Softskills :
PEER LEARNING IS VERY IMPORTANT: you will learn things you codunt have learned.
AANDACHT GEVEN AAN DIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YOU ARE INVESTING YOUR TIME TO LEARN : ALSO PRESENT YOUR TIME TO PRESENT!!!
Make the markdown files , so that others can see your work and results and the things you have learned.

FIll the markdown files immediately along your work and learning.

TO set a good goal you have to use SMART.
