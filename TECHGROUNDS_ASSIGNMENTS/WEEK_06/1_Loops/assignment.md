# [1/ Loops]

You can use loops when you want to run a block of code multiple times. For example, you might want to do an operation on every item in a (large) list, or you want to write an algorithm that follows the same set of instructions for multiple iterations.

There are two types of loops in Python: the *while* loop and the *for* loop.The *while* loop runs while a condition is true. They can run indefinitely if that condition never changes. If your code is stuck in an infinite loop, just press ctrl-c (or command-c on MacOS) to force quit the running code.The *for* loop runs for a predetermined number of iterations. This number can be hard coded using the *range()* function, or dynamically assigned (using a variable, the size of a list, or the number of lines in a document). It is also possible to accidentally create an infinite *for* loop. You can use the same command (ctrl/cmd+c) to exit your program.

## Assignment

Exercise 1:

- Create a new script.
- Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
- Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.Example output:

 Exercise 2:

- Create a new script.
- Copy the code below into your script.

`   for i in range(10):   # do something here   `

- Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
- Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
- Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

 Exercise 3:

- Create a new script.
- Copy the array below into your script.

> `   arr = ["Shikha", "Casper", "Bart", "Ruben", "Ulviye"]   `

- Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.

```
# Create a variable x and give it the value 0

x = 0

# Use a while loop to print the value of x and increase it by 1

while x <= 10:
    print(x)
    x += 1
```

 Exercise 2:

- Create a new script.
- Copy the code below into your script.

`for i in range(10): # do something here`

- Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.

- Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.

- Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.
  
  ```
  # Add a variable x with value 5
  x = 5
  
  # Use a for loop to iterate over a range of 10
  for i in range(10):
      # Print the value of i in the for loop
      print("Value of i:", i)
      # Print the value of x multiplied by the value of i
      print("Value of x * i:", x * i)
  ```
  
  In this script, the `for` loop iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to 9 (inclusive). The variable `i` is automatically assigned each value from the range in each iteration of the loop. Then, the value of `x` is multiplied by the current value of `i`, and the result is printed.

 Exercise 3:

- Create a new script.
- Copy the array below into your script.

> `arr = ["Shikha", "Casper", "Bart", "Ruben", "Ulviye"]`

- Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
  
  ```
  # Define the array
  arr = ["Shikha", "Casper", "Bart", "Ruben", "Ulviye"]
  
  # Use a for loop to iterate over the array
  for name in arr:
      # Print each name individually
      print(name)
  ```
