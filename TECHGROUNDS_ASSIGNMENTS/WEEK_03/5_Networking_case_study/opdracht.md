# [5\ Networking_case_study]

CASE STUDY:
Case studies are a little different from the regular exercises you do here at Techgrounds. Up until now every exercise has introduced a new topic, where you had to figure out how to make it work. In a case study we combine your previously learned knowledge with a real life example (or a fictional example closely resembling a real life situation).

In this case study you take the role of a network administrator setting up a network in the new office of a small e-commerce company. Of course there are multiple ways to go about this problem, but this company has specifically said that network security is extremely important to them.

The office contains the following devices:

- A web server where our webshop is hosted
- A database with login credentials for users on the webshop
- 5 workstations for the office workers
- A printer
- An AD server
- A file server containing internal documents

As a network administrator you get to choose which networking devices get used.
