that make the cloud appealing to businesses. Keep in mind that this also serves as a marketing tool to introduce Azure to new customers. Therefore, it's also an important part of the AZ-900 exam.

The six benefits of cloud computing are:

1. High Availability
   
   - Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA)

2. Scalability
   
   - Both vertically and horizontally

3. Elasticity

4. Agility

5. Geo-distribution

6. Disaster recovery

Azure utilizes a consumption-based model. This means you only pay for the resources you use. Consequently, Capital Expenditure (CapEx) is replaced with Operational Expenditure (OpEx).

## Key-terms

- **AZ-900 exam**: The AZ-900 exam, also known as "Microsoft Azure Fundamentals," is an entry-level certification exam offered by Microsoft. It is designed for individuals who are new to Azure and want to demonstrate foundational knowledge of cloud services and how they are provided with Microsoft Azure.
  
  The AZ-900 exam is an excellent starting point for individuals looking to begin their journey with Azure and gain a foundational understanding of cloud computing concepts and Azure services.

- **The advantages of cloud computing :**
  
  - - **High Availability**: Cloud computing platforms typically offer high availability, meaning that services and resources are accessible and operational with minimal downtime. This is often achieved through redundant infrastructure and data centers, ensuring that even if one server or data center fails, there are backup systems in place to maintain service availability.
    
    - **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Cloud providers often offer SLAs that guarantee certain levels of uptime, performance, and support. These agreements provide customers with assurances regarding the reliability and quality of the services they are subscribing to, which can be crucial for businesses relying on cloud services for their operations.
    
    - **Scalability**: Cloud computing allows for easy and efficient scalability, both vertically and horizontally. Vertical scalability involves increasing the capacity of existing hardware or software resources, such as adding more CPU or memory to a virtual machine. Horizontal scalability involves adding more instances of resources, such as additional servers or storage, to handle increased demand. This scalability ensures that resources can be quickly and dynamically adjusted to accommodate changing workloads or user demands.
    
    - **Elasticity**: Elasticity is a key feature of cloud computing that allows resources to be automatically scaled up or down in response to demand. This means that organizations can optimize resource usage and costs by only paying for the resources they actually use, rather than provisioning and maintaining excess capacity to handle peak loads.
    
    - **Agility**: Cloud computing enables greater agility and flexibility in deploying and managing IT resources. With cloud services, organizations can quickly provision new resources, deploy applications, and scale infrastructure as needed, without the delays and complexities associated with traditional IT infrastructure procurement and deployment.
    
    - **Geo-Distribution**: Many cloud providers operate data centers and infrastructure in multiple geographic regions around the world. This geo-distribution allows organizations to deploy applications and services closer to their users, reducing latency and improving performance. It also provides redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities by spreading data and workloads across multiple locations.
    
    - **Disaster Recovery**: Cloud computing offers robust disaster recovery capabilities, allowing organizations to replicate data and applications across multiple geographically dispersed data centers. In the event of a disaster or outage, data and services can be quickly restored from backup copies, ensuring business continuity and minimizing downtime.

- **Azure consumption-based model ,and how it replaces CapEx with OpEx:**
  
  - 1. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**: Azure offers a wide range of services, including virtual machines, storage, databases, and more, each with its own pricing structure. Customers are charged based on their usage of these services, typically on an hourly or per-unit basis. For example, customers pay for the compute resources (CPU, memory, etc.) used by their virtual machines, the amount of data stored in Azure storage, or the number of transactions processed by their databases.
    
    2. **No Upfront Investment**: Unlike traditional IT infrastructure procurement, where organizations have to make significant upfront investments in hardware, software licenses, and infrastructure, Azure allows customers to avoid these upfront costs. Instead, customers can provision and use cloud resources as needed, without the need to purchase and maintain physical hardware or software licenses.
    
    3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: Azure's consumption-based model offers scalability and flexibility, allowing customers to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand. Customers can easily provision additional resources or scale down existing ones, paying only for the resources they use. This elasticity enables organizations to optimize resource usage and costs based on their actual needs, rather than over-provisioning to accommodate peak loads.
    
    4. **Pay for What You Use**: With Azure's consumption-based pricing, customers only pay for the resources and services they use, providing cost transparency and predictability. This pay-as-you-go model allows organizations to align their IT spending with their actual usage and business needs, avoiding wasted resources and over-spending on unused capacity.
    
    5. **OpEx vs. CapEx**: Azure's consumption-based model shifts IT spending from capital expenditures (CapEx) to operational expenditures (OpEx). Instead of making large upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure, organizations pay for cloud resources as operational expenses, typically on a monthly or quarterly basis. This allows organizations to spread out their IT costs over time, improve cash flow management, and better align expenses with revenue.

- **De 6 advantages of the cloud**
  
  - Cloud computing offers several advantages that make it a popular choice for businesses and organizations: 
    
    - 1. **High Availability**: Azure offers high availability through its globally distributed data centers. This means that applications and services hosted on Azure are designed to be accessible and operational with minimal downtime. Azure provides redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure continuous availability, meeting the requirements specified in service-level agreements (SLAs).
      
      2. **Scalability**: Azure enables both vertical and horizontal scalability. Vertical scalability involves increasing the capacity of a single server or virtual machine by adding more resources such as CPU, memory, or storage. Horizontal scalability, on the other hand, involves adding more instances of servers or virtual machines to distribute the workload. Azure's scalable infrastructure allows businesses to handle increased demand or workload spikes without compromising performance.
      
      3. **Elasticity**: Elasticity in Azure refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand. Azure offers auto-scaling capabilities that automatically adjust resources in response to changing workload patterns. This ensures optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency by provisioning resources only when needed and releasing them when no longer required.
      
      4. **Agility**: Azure provides agility by enabling rapid deployment and iteration of applications and services. With Azure's extensive set of services and tools, developers can quickly build, test, and deploy applications, accelerating time-to-market.

- **Het consumption-based model**
  
  - Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, offers a consumption-based pricing model where customers pay for the resources and services they use, typically on a pay-as-you-go basis. This model contrasts with traditional IT infrastructure procurement, where organizations often make large upfront investments in hardware, software licenses, and infrastructure, known as capital expenditure (CapEx). Instead, with Azure's consumption-based model, customers pay for cloud resources as operational expenses (OpEx), typically on a recurring billing cycle.
  - Overall, Azure's consumption-based model offers organizations greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional IT infrastructure procurement, enabling them to focus on their core business goals and innovate more rapidly. By replacing capital expenditures with operational expenditures, Azure allows organizations to adapt to changing business needs, reduce upfront costs, and pay only for the resources they consume.
