# [4/ Azure Core Services]

You can think of this document as a sort of guide to your AZ-900 certification. It lists the services you need to know in a bit more detail. Additionally, this document describes how to handle the other services you may encounter in the (practice) exam.

There are many services in Azure, but some are more important than others. Azure mentions the following architectural components and services of which you should have a fairly in-depth understanding of what they do:

- Regions and Region Pairs
- Availability Zones
- Resource Groups
- Subscriptions
- Management Groups
- Azure Resource Manager
- Virtual Machines
- Azure App Services
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Azure Virtual Desktop
- Virtual Networks
- VPN Gateway
- Virtual Network Peering
- ExpressRoute
- Container (Blob) Storage
- Disk Storage
- File Storage
- Storage Tiers
- Cosmos DB
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- SQL Managed Instance
- Azure Marketplace

Of course, there are many more services that may appear on your exam. For these services, it's sufficient to be familiar with the product page (see here for an example of an Azure product page).

In addition to services, you can also expect questions about various cloud concepts, such as High Availability, the consumption-based pricing model, and the shared responsibility model.
