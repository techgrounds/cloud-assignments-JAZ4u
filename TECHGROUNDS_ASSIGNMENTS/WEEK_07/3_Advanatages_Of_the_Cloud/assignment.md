# [3/ Advantages of the cloud]

Azure noemt 6 voordelen van cloud computing. Dit zijn basiseigenschappen die de cloud interessant maken voor bedrijven. Houd er rekening mee dat dit gelijk ook een marketing tool is om Azure te introduceren aan nieuwe klanten. Daarom is het ook een belangrijk onderdeel van het AZ-900 examen.

De zes voordelen van cloud computing zijn:

- High Availability

- Afhankelijk van de service-level agreement (SLA)

- Scalability

- Zowel verticaal als horizontaal

- Elasticity

- Agility

- Geo-distribution

- Disaster recovery

Azure maakt gebruik van een consumption-based model. Dat wil zeggen dat je alleen betaalt voor de resources die je gebruikt. Hierdoor wordt Capital Expenditure (CapEx) vervangen voor Operational Expenditure (OpEx).

## Key-terms

- **AZ-900 exam**: The AZ-900 exam, also known as "Microsoft Azure Fundamentals," is an entry-level certification exam offered by Microsoft. It is designed for individuals who are new to Azure and want to demonstrate foundational knowledge of cloud services and how they are provided with Microsoft Azure.
  
  The AZ-900 exam is an excellent starting point for individuals looking to begin their journey with Azure and gain a foundational understanding of cloud computing concepts and Azure services.

- **The advantages of cloud computing :**
  
  - - **High Availability**: Cloud computing platforms typically offer high availability, meaning that services and resources are accessible and operational with minimal downtime. This is often achieved through redundant infrastructure and data centers, ensuring that even if one server or data center fails, there are backup systems in place to maintain service availability.
    
    - **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Cloud providers often offer SLAs that guarantee certain levels of uptime, performance, and support. These agreements provide customers with assurances regarding the reliability and quality of the services they are subscribing to, which can be crucial for businesses relying on cloud services for their operations.
    
    - **Scalability**: Cloud computing allows for easy and efficient scalability, both vertically and horizontally. Vertical scalability involves increasing the capacity of existing hardware or software resources, such as adding more CPU or memory to a virtual machine. Horizontal scalability involves adding more instances of resources, such as additional servers or storage, to handle increased demand. This scalability ensures that resources can be quickly and dynamically adjusted to accommodate changing workloads or user demands.
    
    - **Elasticity**: Elasticity is a key feature of cloud computing that allows resources to be automatically scaled up or down in response to demand. This means that organizations can optimize resource usage and costs by only paying for the resources they actually use, rather than provisioning and maintaining excess capacity to handle peak loads.
    
    - **Agility**: Cloud computing enables greater agility and flexibility in deploying and managing IT resources. With cloud services, organizations can quickly provision new resources, deploy applications, and scale infrastructure as needed, without the delays and complexities associated with traditional IT infrastructure procurement and deployment.
    
    - **Geo-Distribution**: Many cloud providers operate data centers and infrastructure in multiple geographic regions around the world. This geo-distribution allows organizations to deploy applications and services closer to their users, reducing latency and improving performance. It also provides redundancy and disaster recovery capabilities by spreading data and workloads across multiple locations.
    
    - **Disaster Recovery**: Cloud computing offers robust disaster recovery capabilities, allowing organizations to replicate data and applications across multiple geographically dispersed data centers. In the event of a disaster or outage, data and services can be quickly restored from backup copies, ensuring business continuity and minimizing downtime.

- **Azure consumption-based model ,and how it replaces CapEx with OpEx:**
  
  - 1. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**: Azure offers a wide range of services, including virtual machines, storage, databases, and more, each with its own pricing structure. Customers are charged based on their usage of these services, typically on an hourly or per-unit basis. For example, customers pay for the compute resources (CPU, memory, etc.) used by their virtual machines, the amount of data stored in Azure storage, or the number of transactions processed by their databases.
    
    2. **No Upfront Investment**: Unlike traditional IT infrastructure procurement, where organizations have to make significant upfront investments in hardware, software licenses, and infrastructure, Azure allows customers to avoid these upfront costs. Instead, customers can provision and use cloud resources as needed, without the need to purchase and maintain physical hardware or software licenses.
    
    3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: Azure's consumption-based model offers scalability and flexibility, allowing customers to quickly scale resources up or down based on demand. Customers can easily provision additional resources or scale down existing ones, paying only for the resources they use. This elasticity enables organizations to optimize resource usage and costs based on their actual needs, rather than over-provisioning to accommodate peak loads.
    
    4. **Pay for What You Use**: With Azure's consumption-based pricing, customers only pay for the resources and services they use, providing cost transparency and predictability. This pay-as-you-go model allows organizations to align their IT spending with their actual usage and business needs, avoiding wasted resources and over-spending on unused capacity.
    
    5. **OpEx vs. CapEx**: Azure's consumption-based model shifts IT spending from capital expenditures (CapEx) to operational expenditures (OpEx). Instead of making large upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure, organizations pay for cloud resources as operational expenses, typically on a monthly or quarterly basis. This allows organizations to spread out their IT costs over time, improve cash flow management, and better align expenses with revenue.

- **Het consumption-based model**
  
  - Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform, offers a consumption-based pricing model where customers pay for the resources and services they use, typically on a pay-as-you-go basis. This model contrasts with traditional IT infrastructure procurement, where organizations often make large upfront investments in hardware, software licenses, and infrastructure, known as capital expenditure (CapEx). Instead, with Azure's consumption-based model, customers pay for cloud resources as operational expenses (OpEx), typically on a recurring billing cycle.
  - Overall, Azure's consumption-based model offers organizations greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional IT infrastructure procurement, enabling them to focus on their core business goals and innovate more rapidly. By replacing capital expenditures with operational expenditures, Azure allows organizations to adapt to changing business needs, reduce upfront costs, and pay only for the resources they consume.
