# # [2/ Azure Cost Management]

A frequently mentioned benefit of the cloud is that you only pay for what you use. This concerns OPEX expenses instead of CAPEX expenditures. The "Cost Management + Billing" tool provides insight into your expenses in Azure and allows you to manage your subscriptions.

When you create a 'Free Account' or a 'Student Account', Microsoft gives you a certain amount to experiment with Azure. Keep in mind that after 30 days, your subscription will be automatically stopped, resulting in all your running services being shut down.

If you have created a 'Pay-as-you-go' subscription, there are some services that are always free to a certain extent. However, understand that these services are sometimes integrated with other services for which you have to pay.

Azure has the following principles to successfully reduce your costs:

- Plan (Planning)

- Visibility (Visibility)

- Accountability (Accountability)

- Optimization (Optimization)

- Iteration (Iteration)

The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is used to calculate how much an infrastructure costs when hosted in the traditional way. With the TCO calculator, you can compare the costs of a traditional infrastructure with the costs for the same infrastructure on Azure.

## Key-terms

1. **OPEX (Operating Expenses)**: These are ongoing costs associated with running your Azure services, such as usage fees, subscription fees, and maintenance expenses.

2. **CAPEX (Capital Expenditures)**: These are one-time investments in infrastructure or assets, such as purchasing servers or networking equipment. In Azure, CAPEX may also refer to upfront costs for reserved instances or long-term commitments.

3. **Azure “Cost Management + Billing”**: This is a suite of tools and services provided by Azure for managing and optimizing costs. It includes features for monitoring usage, analyzing spending trends, setting budgets, and optimizing resource allocation.

4. **Pay-as-you-go subscription**: Azure offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model, where customers are billed based on their actual usage of Azure services. This provides flexibility and scalability, as customers only pay for what they use, without any long-term commitments.

5. **Azure principles to reduce cost**:
   
   - *Planning*: Strategic planning and forecasting of resource usage to optimize costs.
   - *Visibility*: Monitoring and tracking of usage and spending to identify areas for optimization.
   - *Accountability*: Assigning responsibility for cost management and ensuring adherence to budgetary guidelines.
   - *Optimization*: Implementing cost-saving measures, such as rightsizing resources or leveraging discounts.
   - *Iteration*: Continuously reviewing and refining cost management strategies to adapt to changing business needs.

6. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**: TCO is the total cost associated with owning and operating a particular asset or service over its entire lifecycle. In the context of Azure, TCO analysis helps organizations evaluate the overall cost-effectiveness of using Azure compared to on-premises or alternative cloud solutions.

7. **TCO-calculator**: Azure provides tools and calculators to estimate and compare the total cost of ownership for different deployment scenarios. These calculators take into account factors such as infrastructure costs, operational expenses, and potential savings from using Azure services.

### Result

Study :

- 1. **The Azure principles for cost management**:
     
     - These principles outline best practices and strategies for effectively managing costs when using Azure services. They include:
       - Planning: Strategically plan and forecast resource usage to optimize costs.
       - Visibility: Monitor and track usage and spending to identify areas for optimization.
       - Accountability: Assign responsibility for cost management and ensure adherence to budgetary guidelines.
       - Optimization: Implement cost-saving measures such as rightsizing resources or leveraging discounts.
       - Iteration: Continuously review and refine cost management strategies to adapt to changing business needs.
  
  2. **The terms of the 'Free subscription'**:
     
     - Azure offers a free subscription tier that provides limited access to Azure services at no cost for a certain period, typically 12 months. The terms of the free subscription may vary, but generally, it includes a specific amount of Azure credits that can be used to explore and test various Azure services. However, usage beyond the allocated credits or outside the free services may incur charges. It's essential to review the terms and limitations of the free subscription to avoid unexpected charges.
  
  3. **The difference between CAPEX and OPEX**:
     
     - CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) refers to one-time investments in assets or infrastructure, such as purchasing servers or networking equipment. In the context of Azure, CAPEX may also include upfront costs for reserved instances or long-term commitments.
     - OPEX (Operating Expenses), on the other hand, are ongoing costs associated with running Azure services, such as usage fees, subscription fees, and maintenance expenses. OPEX costs are typically incurred on a regular basis and are treated as operational expenses rather than capital investments.
  
  4. **The TCO calculator**:
     
     - The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator is a tool provided by Azure to estimate and compare the total cost of owning and operating a particular workload or deployment scenario in Azure compared to on-premises or alternative cloud solutions. The TCO calculator takes into account factors such as infrastructure costs, operational expenses, and potential savings from using Azure services. It helps organizations make informed decisions about the cost-effectiveness of migrating to Azure and provides insights into potential cost savings.
Task:

- 1. **Set up Cost Management Alerts**:
     
     - Go to the Azure portal ([https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/)) and sign in with your Azure account.
     - In the Azure portal, navigate to the "Cost Management + Billing" section.
     - Select "Cost Management" from the menu.
     - In the Cost Management blade, select "Cost alerts" from the left-hand menu.
     - Click on "+ Add" to create a new cost alert.
     - Configure the alert criteria, such as the spending threshold, alert frequency, and notification preferences (e.g., email or SMS).
     - Save the alert configuration.
  
  2. **Understand Azure Cost Management Options**:
     
     - In the "Cost Management + Billing" section of the Azure portal, explore the various options available for viewing and managing your expenses.
     - Review the "Cost Analysis" dashboard to gain insights into your spending trends, cost breakdown by service, and forecasted costs.
     - Utilize the "Budgets" feature to set spending limits and receive notifications when you approach or exceed your budget.
     - Explore the "Invoice" section to view detailed billing information, including usage charges, credits, and taxes.
     - Check out the "Usage Details" to drill down into specific usage metrics and costs associated with individual Azure resources.
     - Take advantage of the "Recommendations" tab to identify potential cost-saving opportunities and optimization suggestions.
