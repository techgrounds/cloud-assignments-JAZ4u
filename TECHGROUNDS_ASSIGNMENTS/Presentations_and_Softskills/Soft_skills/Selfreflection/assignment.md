Self-reflection is a crucial skill for personal and professional development. It involves objectively examining one's actions, understanding motivations, and identifying areas for improvement. Here's a summary of key points:

**What is self-reflection?**
Self-reflection is figuratively looking in the mirror to evaluate personal and professional actions, decision-making, and skillsets. It involves learning from experiences and linking them to learning objectives.

**Importance of self-reflection:**
It is a form of learning that enables individuals to critically assess their actions, take charge of personal growth, and maximize their potential.

**Difference between self-reflection, reflecting, and evaluating:**

- Self-reflection: Done individually or with a coach, focuses on observing one's own actions and emotions, assessing behaviors, and improving future actions.
- Reflecting: Often done collaboratively, aims to understand motivations behind actions to make improvements.
- Evaluating: Involves assessing project expectations and results, drawing comparisons, and making conclusions for future projects.

**Reflecting in collaboration:**
Involving others in the self-reflection process provides valuable feedback, helps identify blind spots, and fosters a culture of continuous improvement and teamwork.

**Reflection models:**
Several models support the reflection process, such as the STARR method, Korthagen model, and Gibbs model, which guide individuals through structured reflection phases.

**Tips for self-reflection:**

1) Make self-reflection a habit by scheduling regular sessions.
2) Strive to be objective and avoid judgment.
3) Utilize reflection models to guide the pr8`ocess effectively.

Incorporating self-reflection into routine practice can lead to personal and professional growth by enhancing self-awareness and driving continuous improvement.

## Key-terms

1. **STARR Method:** The STARR method is a structured approach to reflection, commonly used in evaluating experiences or events. It stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result, and Reflection. Each component prompts individuals to systematically analyze a situation, their role within it, the actions taken, outcomes achieved, and reflections on the experience.

2. **Korthagen Model:** The Korthagen model is a reflective learning model developed by Fred Korthagen. It consists of five phases:
   
   - **Action:** Identifying goals, intentions, and actions taken.
   - **Reflect:** Examining the thoughts, feelings, and experiences during the action phase.
   - **Awareness:** Understanding the connections between actions, thoughts, and feelings.
   - **Alternative:** Exploring alternative perspectives or actions and their potential consequences.
   - **Experiment:** Implementing new approaches, learning from mistakes, and refining strategies.

3. **Gibbs Model:** The Gibbs model is a structured reflection model commonly used in healthcare and education. It involves six stages:
   
   - **Description:** Describing the event or experience.
   - **Feelings:** Expressing thoughts and emotions related to the experience.
   - **Evaluation:** Assessing what went well or poorly during the experience.
   - **Analysis:** Analyzing the situation, identifying key factors and implications.
   - **Conclusion:** Drawing conclusions about the experience, identifying lessons learned.
   - **Action Plan:** Developing strategies for future actions based on insights gained from reflection.
