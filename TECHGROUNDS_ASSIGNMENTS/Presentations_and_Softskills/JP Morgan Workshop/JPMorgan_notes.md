Gabi:
Was a sport 
Atlette : learned to go for goals. Sometimes you get them or you dont. 
Personal Brand : what you want to be known for ?
She minded het looks and her habits , for example to be on time, trustworthy .That feels more confident.
She wants to make sure she has a name of " she will get it done" 

Personal Brand is something you stand for.
What happens if it gets damaged? Ask more questions : to find out about the critique. 
Maybe it was something in a blind spot. And maybe the critique could be valid and handled.  So that I am a better person afterwards. 

Tips :

-everyone can bring something to the table
-

JP MOEGAN Employees:

Umbra:

-prsent yourself accordingly and sluiting, if kindness is required : prove it , show it

Look at the company website!
Get general knowledge about the sector. 
Look at role : also preparation
Try to know who will be the interviewer: afapt to him when possible. Make questions which he may like and know. 

Apply the STAR format. When applicable.

Situation : describe situation you had to deal with
Task: the task you were given to 
Action: the action you took 
Result: what happened as a result , what did you learn 

Reminder : prepare question's for the interviewer . 

Tip: Write good motivational letters , not everyone takes time to do this, you can outstand here.
- practise interview with friends 
- even if you do not have all prerequisites : go for it
- first look is CV, make it NEEAAAT!  This is the first thing people see and can reject you on. 
- make a great LinkedIn profile!
- do not get discouraged , apply rigt the next day


Regarding questions at interview: 
- you learn more about the position , you show interest and preparation. 
- you get to know each other better and have a more equal position towards eachother
- tip : ask about the process after the application 
- do NOT ask about the salary rigtaway, this comes later when they like you: then you have a better negotiation position too.
Do not come over and a moneyhunter. 
Mind that you should really like the job and environment, over the pay. Otherwise it could be realy frustrating and end not very well. 

Pascal :
Tip : ask questions of examples , so you do know the task and what you are expected to do

He did the TELL YOUR LIFE STORY: 
He did it with connection , he told about his challenges (languages) he had,  and how he  overcame them. 
- he told about the things he liked 
- he tried to emphasize , to tell your life story really as a story. 


Tamil Arends (director) :
Gave an example of his customer RTL, about what the right price was . 
He mentioned , he is director: he finds it IMPORTANT that someone is PREPARED. And he told us that he encounters people who are supersmart or experienced com UNPREPARED.

Take time why you are required , and useful for a company . This is NUMBER ONE for him !
Again do not make your cv and motivation letter in a rush. 
He likes that , as a person from the hiring side. 

He wants that the person is loyaal , likeable to work with , is it a Yes sayer , is he authentic , is he being hisdelf . Try to connect with the person , with who you are. 

Interview = 3way street , try to get in your own information. 
He liked that people questioned about him too  . Personal questions. 
Try to fit in the team , feel happy. 
If you are not happy , the chance that you fail or leave us high and they want longterm relationships. 

He also likes the MOTIVATION : does the person know something about the company. Has this person though about why this person is a good fit , and about what he can deliver to the table???

AFTER THIS : then the papers and qualifications are looked at. 

He said : he likes to ask for EXAMPLES! 

He would ask for an example of team work in real life . Like with family of with Friends. 

If you are confronted with a question which you can not answer : make it broader , or give a similar example. 

This guy does not like : made up BS. A no go!
Say instead  " I do not know" , and tell something which you DO know ( relatable) 



Exercise 
1 minute pitch , with feedback . 

Feedback about my life story speech :
- make it short , i exceeded 1 minute

. And where I want to head to .

- you do not have to go too deep at first

- make a story , that is easier to remember also.
