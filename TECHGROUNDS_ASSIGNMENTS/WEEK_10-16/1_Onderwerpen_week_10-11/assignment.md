# [1/ Topics week 10-11]

From this point on, you will receive fewer concrete assignments. We will rely more on your independent learning skills. Don't worry, you are not alone. You have each other, and the established structure remains, allowing you to ask as many questions as you need.

Some services you only need to know theoretically. Others, you need to have at least started and configured once. Each topic will indicate whether it is theoretical or practical.

Useful questions to keep in mind (or must) during your research into the topics:

- What problem does X solve?

- What are the key terms associated with X?

- How does X fit into or replace an on-premises setting?

- How can I combine X with other services?

- What is the difference between X and other similar services?

A useful list of tasks you should be able to do practically:

- Where can I find this service in the console?
- How do I enable this service?
- How can I connect this service to other resources?

## Key-terms
