# [1/ Azure files, App Service, CDN, DNS, SQL]

From this moment on, you'll receive fewer concrete assignments. We're relying more on your independent learning skills. Don't worry, you're not alone. You have each other, and the established structure remains in place where you can still ask everyone questions endlessly.

Some services you only need to know theoretically. Others you should have at least turned on and configured once. Each topic describes whether it's a theoretical or practical subject.

Useful questions to keep (/must keep) in mind during your research on the topics:

- What problem does X solve?
- What key terms are associated with X?
- How does X fit in / replace X in an on-premises setting?
- How can I combine X with other services?
- What is the difference between X and other similar services?

A handy list of tasks you should be able to perform practically:

- Where can I find this service in the console?
- How do I turn on this service?
- How can I link this service to other resources?

## Key-terms

1. **Azure Files**:
   
   - **What is it?**: Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud, accessible via the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
   - **Practical Experience**: You can create and manage file shares in Azure Files to store and access files from anywhere. This can be useful for applications that require shared file storage or for backing up files in the cloud.

2. **SQL Databases in Azure**:
   
   - **What is it?**: Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service provided by Microsoft in the Azure cloud.
   - **Practical Experience**: With Azure SQL Database, you can create and manage relational databases without the need to manage underlying infrastructure. You can provision databases, manage security, and scale resources as needed to handle your application workload.

3. **Azure App Service**:
   
   - **What is it?**: Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications and APIs.
   - **Practical Experience**: You can deploy web applications written in various programming languages such as .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP to Azure App Service. It offers features like automatic scaling, continuous deployment, and integration with Azure services for building modern cloud applications.

4. **Azure CDN (Content Delivery Network)**:
   
   - **What is it?**: Azure CDN is a global content delivery network that helps deliver high-bandwidth content to users with low latency and high availability.
   - **Practical Experience**: By configuring Azure CDN, you can cache static content like images, videos, scripts, and stylesheets closer to your users, resulting in faster load times and reduced bandwidth costs. You can integrate Azure CDN with various Azure services like Blob Storage, Web Apps, and Media Services to accelerate content delivery.

5. **Azure DNS**:
   
   - **What is it?**: Azure DNS is a hosting service for Domain Name System (DNS) domains that provides name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure.
   - **Practical Experience**: With Azure DNS, you can manage DNS records for your domain names hosted in Azure. This includes creating, updating, and deleting DNS records such as A, CNAME, MX, and TXT records. Azure DNS provides high availability and low-latency DNS resolution for your applications and services running in Azure.
