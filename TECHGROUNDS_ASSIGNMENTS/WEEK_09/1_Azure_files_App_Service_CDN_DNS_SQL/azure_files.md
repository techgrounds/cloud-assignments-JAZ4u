# [1/ Azure files, App Service, CDN, DNS, SQL]

From this moment on, you'll receive fewer concrete assignments. We're relying more on your independent learning skills. Don't worry, you're not alone. You have each other, and the established structure remains in place where you can still ask everyone questions endlessly.

Some services you only need to know theoretically. Others you should have at least turned on and configured once. Each topic describes whether it's a theoretical or practical subject.

Useful questions to keep (/must keep) in mind during your research on the topics:

- What problem does X solve?
- What key terms are associated with X?
- How does X fit in / replace X in an on-premises setting?
- How can I combine X with other services?
- What is the difference between X and other similar services?

A handy list of tasks you should be able to perform practically:

- Where can I find this service in the console?
- How do I turn on this service?
- How can I link this service to other resources?

# Azure files



## Key-terms

1. **Azure Files**:
   
   - **What is it?**: Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud, accessible via the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.
   - **Practical Experience**: You can create and manage file shares in Azure Files to store and access files from anywhere. This can be useful for applications that require shared file storage or for backing up files in the cloud.

  To gain cost-efficient practical experience with Azure Files in Azure, follow these steps:
  
  1. **Azure Free Account**: Sign up for an Azure free account if you haven't already. This provides you with a limited amount of Azure services, including Azure Files, for free during the initial period.
  
  2. **Choose the Right Pricing Tier**: When creating an Azure Files share, choose the appropriate pricing tier based on your requirements. Consider starting with the Standard tier, which offers lower costs compared to the Premium tier.
  
  3. **Optimize Storage Usage**: Efficiently manage your storage usage to minimize costs. Set appropriate quotas for file shares and regularly monitor usage to avoid unnecessary storage consumption.
  
  4. **Leverage Cool and Archive Tiers**: For data that is infrequently accessed, consider using Azure Files with the Cool or Archive tier. These tiers offer lower storage costs compared to the Hot tier, with the trade-off of slightly higher access costs.
  
  5. **Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS)**: Securely share access to Azure Files by using Shared Access Signatures (SAS). This allows you to control access permissions and expiration times, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential costs.
  
  6. **Implement Lifecycle Policies**: Implement lifecycle management policies to automatically tier files to cooler storage tiers or delete outdated files. This helps optimize storage costs by moving inactive data to lower-cost storage tiers or removing unnecessary data altogether.
  
  7. **Utilize Snapshots**: Take advantage of Azure Files snapshots to create point-in-time backups of your file shares. Snapshots provide a cost-effective way to protect your data without incurring the cost of storing multiple copies of files.
  
  8. **Monitor and Optimize Data Transfer**: Monitor data transfer costs associated with Azure Files, especially if you're accessing files from different regions or over the internet. Optimize data transfer by minimizing unnecessary transfers and leveraging Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster access.
  
  9. **Explore Integration with Other Services**: Experiment with integrating Azure Files with other Azure services such as Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), and Azure App Service. Explore use cases where Azure Files can be used as shared storage for applications hosted on these services.
  
  10. **Monitor and Manage Access Controls**: Regularly review and manage access controls for Azure Files to ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to the data. This helps prevent unauthorized access and potential cost implications associated with data breaches.
  
  11. **Stay Informed**: Stay informed about new features, best practices, and cost-saving strategies related to Azure Files by regularly checking official documentation, blogs, forums, and community resources. Continuously evaluate and adjust your usage patterns to optimize costs while gaining practical experience with Azure Files.
  
  By following these steps and actively managing your Azure Files resources, you can gain cost-efficient practical experience while effectively leveraging the capabilities of Azure Files for file storage and sharing in Azure.
