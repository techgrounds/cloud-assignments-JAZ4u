# [1/ Azure files, App Service, CDN, DNS, SQL]

From this moment on, you'll receive fewer concrete assignments. We're relying more on your independent learning skills. Don't worry, you're not alone. You have each other, and the established structure remains in place where you can still ask everyone questions endlessly.

Some services you only need to know theoretically. Others you should have at least turned on and configured once. Each topic describes whether it's a theoretical or practical subject.

Useful questions to keep (/must keep) in mind during your research on the topics:

- What problem does X solve?
- What key terms are associated with X?
- How does X fit in / replace X in an on-premises setting?
- How can I combine X with other services?
- What is the difference between X and other similar services?

A handy list of tasks you should be able to perform practically:

- Where can I find this service in the console?
- How do I turn on this service?
- How can I link this service to other resources?

## Key-terms



1. **SQL Databases in Azure**:
   
   - **What is it?**: Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service provided by Microsoft in the Azure cloud.
   - **Practical Experience**: With Azure SQL Database, you can create and manage relational databases without the need to manage underlying infrastructure. You can provision databases, manage security, and scale resources as needed to handle your application workload.

  To gain cost-efficient practical experience with SQL Databases in Azure, follow these steps:
  
  1. **Azure Free Account**: Sign up for an Azure free account to access a limited amount of Azure services for free, including Azure SQL Database, during the initial period.
  
  2. **Choose the Right Service Tier**: Select the appropriate service tier and performance level for your SQL Database based on your workload requirements. Start with the basic or standard tier to keep costs low initially.
  
  3. **Right-Size Resources**: Optimize the configuration of your SQL Database to match your workload's requirements. Adjust the compute and storage resources based on usage patterns to avoid over-provisioning and unnecessary costs.
  
  4. **Use Serverless Compute**: Consider using Azure SQL Database serverless compute option for sporadic workloads. With serverless compute, you only pay for the compute resources used per second, making it cost-efficient for unpredictable workloads.
  
  5. **Explore Reserved Capacity**: Explore the option of purchasing reserved capacity for Azure SQL Database. Reserved capacity offers significant cost savings compared to pay-as-you-go pricing, especially for long-term commitments.
  
  6. **Use Azure Hybrid Benefit**: If you have existing SQL Server licenses with Software Assurance, take advantage of Azure Hybrid Benefit to save on SQL Database costs. Azure Hybrid Benefit allows you to use your on-premises SQL Server licenses to pay a reduced rate on Azure SQL Database.
  
  7. **Leverage Elastic Pools**: If you have multiple databases with varying usage patterns, consider using Azure SQL Database elastic pools. Elastic pools allow you to share resources among multiple databases, reducing costs compared to provisioning separate databases.
  
  8. **Monitor and Optimize Performance**: Continuously monitor the performance of your SQL Database using Azure Monitor and Azure SQL Analytics. Identify and optimize queries, indexes, and database design to improve performance and reduce resource utilization, leading to cost savings.
  
  9. **Implement Data Retention Policies**: Define and implement data retention policies to manage the storage costs of your SQL Database. Regularly review and archive unnecessary data to minimize storage consumption and associated costs.
  
  10. **Explore Cost Management Tools**: Use Azure Cost Management and Billing tools to track, analyze, and optimize your SQL Database spending. Set budgets, create alerts, and analyze cost trends to identify opportunities for cost savings.
  
  11. **Learn Best Practices**: Educate yourself on best practices for optimizing SQL Database costs in Azure. Follow Azure documentation, whitepapers, and online resources to stay updated on cost-saving strategies and recommendations.
  
  12. **Experiment with Development/Test Environments**: Use Azure SQL Database for development and testing purposes. Take advantage of the free tier or lower-priced service tiers for non-production workloads to minimize costs while gaining practical experience.
