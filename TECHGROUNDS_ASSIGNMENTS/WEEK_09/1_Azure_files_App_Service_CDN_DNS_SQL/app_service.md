From this moment on, you'll receive fewer concrete assignments. We're relying more on your independent learning skills. Don't worry, you're not alone. You have each other, and the established structure remains in place where you can still ask everyone questions endlessly.

Some services you only need to know theoretically. Others you should have at least turned on and configured once. Each topic describes whether it's a theoretical or practical subject.

Useful questions to keep (/must keep) in mind during your research on the topics:

- What problem does X solve?
- What key terms are associated with X?
- How does X fit in / replace X in an on-premises setting?
- How can I combine X with other services?
- What is the difference between X and other similar services?

A handy list of tasks you should be able to perform practically:

- Where can I find this service in the console?
- How do I turn on this service?
- How can I link this service to other resources?

# App Service



## Key-terms



1. **Azure App Service**:
   
   - **What is it?**: Azure App Service is a fully managed platform for building, deploying, and scaling web applications and APIs.
   - **Practical Experience**: You can deploy web applications written in various programming languages such as .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP to Azure App Service. It offers features like automatic scaling, continuous deployment, and integration with Azure services for building modern cloud applications.

- **Azure App Service**
   To gain cost-efficient practical experience with Azure App Service, follow these steps:

- 1. **Azure Free Account**: Sign up for an Azure free account to access a limited amount of Azure services for free, including Azure App Service, during the initial period.
  
  2. **Start with Shared or Basic Tier**: Begin with the Shared or Basic tier of Azure App Service, which offers lower costs compared to higher tiers. These tiers are suitable for lightweight applications or for development and testing purposes.
  
  3. **Right-Size Resources**: Optimize the configuration of your Azure App Service plan based on your application's resource requirements. Choose the appropriate number of instances, CPU cores, and memory to match your workload without over-provisioning.
  
  4. **Auto-Scale Based on Demand**: Utilize auto-scaling features available in Azure App Service to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand. This ensures that you only pay for the resources you need during peak usage periods, reducing costs during idle times.
  
  5. **Use Azure Functions for Serverless Workloads**: Consider using Azure Functions for serverless compute workloads instead of traditional Azure App Service plans. Azure Functions offer a pay-per-execution pricing model, which can be more cost-efficient for sporadic or event-driven workloads.
  
  6. **Leverage Deployment Slots**: Take advantage of deployment slots in Azure App Service for staging and testing deployments. Deployment slots allow you to deploy your application to a separate environment without incurring additional costs, ensuring that your production environment remains unaffected.
  
  7. **Implement Caching and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Implement caching mechanisms and utilize CDNs to improve performance and reduce the load on your Azure App Service instances. Cached content reduces the number of requests served directly from your application, potentially lowering costs associated with data transfer and compute resources.
  
  8. **Optimize Database Usage**: If your application relies on a database, optimize database queries, indexes, and configurations to minimize resource consumption. Utilize database scaling options and consider using Azure SQL Database Elastic Pools for cost-efficient management of multiple databases.
  
  9. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Continuously monitor resource usage and performance metrics of your Azure App Service instances using Azure Monitor. Identify opportunities for optimization and adjust resource allocations accordingly to avoid unnecessary costs.
  
  10. **Implement Cost Management Policies**: Set up cost management policies and budget alerts to monitor and control spending on Azure App Service. Define spending limits and receive notifications when spending exceeds predefined thresholds, allowing you to take corrective actions promptly.
  
  11. **Explore Reserved Instances**: Consider purchasing reserved instances for Azure App Service plans to benefit from discounted pricing compared to pay-as-you-go rates. Reserved instances offer significant cost savings for long-term commitments, especially for production workloads with predictable usage patterns.
  
  12. **Stay Informed**: Stay informed about cost-saving features, best practices, and updates related to Azure App Service through official documentation, blogs, forums, and community resources. Continuously evaluate and adjust your deployment strategies to optimize costs while gaining practical experience with Azure App Service.
