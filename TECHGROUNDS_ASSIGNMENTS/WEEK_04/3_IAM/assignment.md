# [3/ IAM]

- Security goes in two steps: authentication and authorization. Both are two different actions that happen whenever you log in.

        Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a common way to improve security.It is best         practice to follow the principle of least privilege for authorization.

- IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a framework of policies and technologies that ensures the right individuals have appropriate access to technology resources within an organization. It involves managing digital identities, authentication, authorization, and accountability to secure systems, applications, and data.

## Key-terms

- IAM
  
   stands for Identity and Access Management. In the context of networks and information technology, IAM refers to the framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the right individuals have the appropriate access to technology resources. This includes systems, applications, and data, and it involves managing digital identities and their permissions within an organization.
  
  IAM systems typically involve processes for authentication, authorization, and accountability.
  
  1. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users, typically through methods like passwords, biometric scans, security tokens, or multi-factor authentication.
  
  2. **Authorization**: Determining what actions and resources users are allowed to access based on their authenticated identity. This involves assigning permissions and privileges, often through role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) mechanisms.
  
  3. **Accountability**: Logging and monitoring user activities to ensure compliance, detect unauthorized access, and facilitate forensic analysis in case of security incidents.
  
  IAM helps organizations manage user access across various platforms and applications securely. It ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive information and resources, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
