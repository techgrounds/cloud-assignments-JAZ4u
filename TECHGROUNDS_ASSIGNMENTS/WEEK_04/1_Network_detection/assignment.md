# [1/ Network detection]

In order to prevent or stop attacks on a network, you must be able to analyse your network. There are many tools available to do this, but this exercise will focus on two very popular ones: nmap and Wireshark.

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a tool that scans a network to find information about it. For example, what ports are open in a host in your network. Wireshark is a protocol analyzer. It looks at network traffic and shows information about packets like protocol and destination (among other things).

## Key-terms

- nmap (Network Mapper)

- network attacks

- protocal analyser

- Wireshark

- network packets

## Assignment

Study:

- Scan the network of your Linux machine using nmap. What do you find?
- Open Wireshark in Windows/MacOS Machine. Analyse what happens when you open an internet browser. (Tip: you will find that Zoom is constantly sending packets over the network. You can either turn off Zoom for a minute, or look for the packets sent by the browser between the packets sent by Zoom.)
