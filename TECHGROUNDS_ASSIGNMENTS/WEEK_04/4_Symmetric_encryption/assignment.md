# [4/ Symmetric encryption]

Encryption is an important tool for securing data. Be it data at rest, or data in motion. A lot of what you do on your computer and the Internet is encrypted.

Throughout history humanity has come up with many ciphers to encode information. Most of these are symmetric ciphers, the most famous one being the Caesar cipher.

In this assignment you will learn about the basics of cryptography, starting with symmetrical encryption.

## Key-terms

[Schrijf hier een lijst met belangrijke termen met eventueel een korte uitleg.]

## Assignment

- Find one more historic cipher besides the Caesar cipher.
- Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.
- Send a symmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone. You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides the public Slack channel. Analyse the shortcomings of symmetric encryption for sending messages.
