# [2/ Shared responsabillity model]

If you manage your own data center, you are responsible for everything: from physical security to securing and encrypting your data. This includes maintenance and management of the building where your data center is located, as well as all the staff needed for it.

In the Cloud, many of these responsibilities are taken over. The Cloud Provider is then responsible for the physical aspects of your infrastructure. As a customer, you can rent this infrastructure without having to worry about it.

However, this is not a free pass. You, as a customer, are still responsible for what you do on this rented infrastructure. These responsibilities include access control to data and software, encryption of data at rest and data in transit.

The extent of customer responsibilities also depends on the type of service being used. Nonetheless, there are responsibilities that always remain with the customer.

Cloud providers offer additional services that make it easier for you to manage your own responsibilities.

## Key-terms

- The Azure Shared Responsibility model: 
  
  refers to the division of responsibilities between Microsoft Azure as a cloud service provider and its customers. This model delineates which aspects of security, compliance, and management are the responsibility of Azure and which are the responsibility of the customer.
  
  In general, Azure is responsible for the security and maintenance of the underlying cloud infrastructure, including physical facilities, networking, and hardware. On the other hand, customers are responsible for securing their data, managing access controls, configuring network settings, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements within the cloud environment.
  
  This model helps clarify the roles and expectations of both parties, promoting a secure and compliant cloud computing environment.

- (Azure) SaaS , PaaS , IaaS :
  In Azure, you can find a range of cloud computing services categorized into three main models: Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
  
  1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**:
     
     - SaaS offerings in Azure are fully managed applications that are hosted and maintained by Microsoft. Users can access these applications via the internet without needing to manage underlying infrastructure or software updates. Examples of SaaS offerings in Azure include Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365), Dynamics 365, and Azure DevOps.
  
  2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:
     
     - PaaS offerings in Azure provide a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. Azure PaaS offerings typically include services such as databases, web hosting, and development frameworks. Examples of PaaS offerings in Azure include Azure App Service, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Functions.
  
  3. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:
     
     - IaaS offerings in Azure provide virtualized computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. With Azure IaaS, users have more control over the underlying infrastructure compared to PaaS or SaaS offerings. They can deploy and manage virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking resources as needed. Examples of IaaS offerings in Azure include Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Virtual Network.

  Studying the Azure Shared Responsibility model entails understanding the division of responsibilities between Microsoft Azure as the cloud service provider and its customers. Here's a breakdown to guide your study:
  
  1. **Core Concept**: Understand the fundamental idea behind the Azure Shared Responsibility model, which is to clarify who is responsible for what in terms of security, compliance, and management within the Azure environment.
  
  2. **Provider Responsibilities**: Learn about the responsibilities that Microsoft Azure undertakes. This includes:
     
     - Physical data center infrastructure, such as buildings, networking equipment, and servers.
     - Virtualization infrastructure, including the hypervisor layer.
     - Networking, ensuring the availability and security of network infrastructure.
     - Data center security, including physical security measures and environmental controls.
     - Compliance certifications and audits for Azure services.
  
  3. **Customer Responsibilities**: Familiarize yourself with the responsibilities that customers bear when using Azure services. These may include:
     
     - Securing data and applications deployed on Azure.
     - Managing user access and permissions.
     - Configuring network security groups and firewalls.
     - Implementing encryption for data at rest and in transit.
     - Ensuring compliance with industry regulations and standards applicable to their workloads.
  
  4. **Collaboration and Cooperation**: Recognize that effective implementation of the shared responsibility model requires collaboration and cooperation between Azure and its customers. Azure provides tools, services, and guidance to help customers fulfill their responsibilities effectively.
  
  5. **Examples and Case Studies**: Explore real-world examples and case studies that illustrate how the shared responsibility model applies in various scenarios. This can deepen your understanding of practical implementations and best practices.
  
  6. **Updates and Changes**: Stay informed about any updates or changes to the Azure Shared Responsibility model. Microsoft periodically updates its documentation and guidelines to reflect evolving security and compliance requirements.
  
  By thoroughly studying the Azure Shared Responsibility model, you'll gain insights into the roles and responsibilities of both Azure and its customers, enabling you to effectively secure and manage workloads deployed on the Azure platform.
